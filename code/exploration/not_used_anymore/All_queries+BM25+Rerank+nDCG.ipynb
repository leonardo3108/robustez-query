Pressure waves depend on the presence of a medium such as air for it to travel through. Without the medium they cannot travel. Therefore neither A, C or D could travel through space as space is a vacuum lacking a medium. However, radio waves can travel through space.

Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second.

Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little.
