It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT. L-carnitine is formed in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine and methionine. However, it is stored elsewhere in the body, primarily in muscle (including the heart), the brain, and even in sperm. In the diet, it mainly comes from meat and other animal products.\n",

L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n",
