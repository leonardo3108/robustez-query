After day 19, stop turning the eggs. Special Incubation Notes: Start up your incubator 2-3 days before your eggs are due to arrive.\n",

Thyroid problems are much more common in women than in men. Defects in these regulatory pathways rarely may result in hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid problem) or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid problem). 2 The most common cause of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism occurs due to problems within the thyroid and not the regulatory system.\n",
